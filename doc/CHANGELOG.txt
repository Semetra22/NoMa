1.0.2
------
* major rewrite
* now runs as a daemon
* fixed timezone support - daylight saving will be taken into account (but N.B. the DateTime::TimeZone perl library sometimes uses very
  old timezone information - if necessary recompile it using the latest info)
* threaded support - requires a bug-free thread implementation
* each notification method has its own thread - voice calls will be sequential but will not block the other methods
* status information (send "status" as a command and look in the debug log)
* notifications queued via pipe or socket (using Nagios notification plugin "alert_via_noma")
* improved logging
* simplified method escalation
* notifications start with 1
* removed timezone from notifications - we now only care about the timezone that the contact is in
* working hours can now be specified as multiple periods
* various bugfixes
* init scripts for daemon
* thread pool for tcp connections should prevent memory exhaustion
* watchdog thread restarts the daemon if there is a memory leak

------

  old timezone information - if necessary recompile it using the latest info)

* each notification method has its own thread - voice calls will be sequential but will not block the other methods
* status information (send "status" as a command and look in the debug log)
* notifications queued via pipe or socket (using Nagios notification plugin "alert_via_noma")
* improved logging
* simplified method escalation
* notifications start with 1
* removed timezone from notifications - we now only care about the timezone that the contact is in
* working hours can now be specified as multiple periods
* various bugfixes

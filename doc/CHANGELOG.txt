* added $host_alias as a default value to notify with via email. Note that there currently as of Nagios 3.2.3 is a bug regarding hostalias not being updated in the retention.dat file on reload/restart. (Ticket: #-)

* added new method of notification: Growl, see documentation for how to use. (Ticket: #800)
* holidays can now have names when used with both contacts and timeframes for easier identification. (possible to have several holidays on both contacts and timeframes). (Ticket: #843) (bonus for contacts)
* notifications can now have names for easier identification. (Ticket: #837)
* linked objects: one can now see linked objects relevant to the selected type, ie for a contact relevant links are; groups, notifications and escalations. added similar for contactgroups and timeframes. Should be less clicking around to get the information needed now. (Tickets: #845, #847, #849)

### Fixes

issues you encounter with NoMaa


How does it work
----------------
When Nagios/Icinga/Shinken/Centreon Engine notifies NoMa, instead of
the core blocking each notification to every user through every
method used in your setup, its one single notification to NoMa.
NoMa then uses the configured filters to notify contacts via
the preconfigured methods, E-Mail, SMS, Voicecall, Growl etc.

The beuty of NoMa is that its a graphical interface to managing
notifications rather than complex configuration files. Its easy
for other admins in your environment to set themselves to vacation,
change what they want to be notified about and most importantly,
WHEN to be notified.

Installation
------------
Pre Requirements:
- Lots of Perl(s).

Download NoMa from a trusted source.

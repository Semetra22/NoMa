makes managing Nagios notifications easier. It lets you create and
modify standard notifications, escalations, schedules and vacations
for your monitoring system.

source code.

issues you encounter with NoMa


How does it work
----------------
When Nagios/Icinga/Shinken/Centreon Engine notifies NoMa, instead of
the core blocking each notification to every user through every
method used in your setup, it's one single notification to NoMa.
NoMa then uses the configured filters to notify contacts via
the preconfigured methods, E-Mail, SMS, Voicecall, Growl etc.

The beauty of NoMa is that it's a graphical interface for managing
notifications rather than complex configuration files. It's easy
for other admins in your environment to set themselves to vacation,
change what they want to be notified about and most importantly,
WHEN to be notified.

Installation
------------
Pre Requirements:
- Lots of Perl(s).
- php5 modules - among others; yaml, sqlite (or mysql if you are feeling adventurous)

Download NoMa from a trusted source.
.....
 #> ./configure --help (to view available switches for easy install)
 #> ./configure <switches> (or none for default paths)
 #> make all
 #> make install
.....

Don't forget: the full documentation is available in the doc/ subdirectory of the
source code.

Then copy one of the init scripts from the notifier to the appropriate
place for your system (e.g. /etc/init.d) and install it with chkconfig
or update-rc.d or similar.

HAVE fun and don't get spammed!
